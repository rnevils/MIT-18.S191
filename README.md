## Introduction to Computational Thinking for Real-World Problems - HW Solutions

This repo holds my HW solutions for the MIT's 18.S191 course (Introduction to Computational Thinking for Real-World Problems). 

<sub>(from class syllabus)</sub>
> This is an introductory course on Computational Thinking, using the modern `Julia` programming language, to approach real-world problems in the following areas via data analysis and computational and mathematical modeling. In this class you will learn applications, computer science, software, algorithms, and mathematics as an integrated whole.
> - Image analysis
> - Particle dynamics and ray tracing
> - Epidemic propagation
> - Climate modeling

### Solutions

The hw files are all meant to be run in a Pluto Notebook. While they are still normal .jl files, if you do not have Pluto installed it will be hard to tell what's going on just by looking at the source code. Luckily, Pluto allows exporting of the notbooks to html pages, so the solutions below are links to a static html page of the pluto notebook.
